        I found after years of trying to get a clear picture of my budget, that the fancy apps that connected to
        all of my bank accounts and credit cards weren't working for me. The automagicness of it all meant that
        I just forgot to check up on it. I needed something a bit more hands on so that I'd be connecting with it
        on a more regular basis. I also wanted more control over the categories of my spending so that I could get
        a really granular understanding of my finances. Enter Flask of Finances, a fully customizable expense and
        income tracking progressive web app built with React and Flask. <br /> Guest account credentials "Guest" | "password"</p>

      description={<p>
        CozyBaby is my custom solution to monitor the temperature in my baby's room. We live in an old building with manual heat controls, 
        so every night we look at the predicted low temperature for the night, then try to guess what level to set the heaters at and how 
        warmly to dress him. I wanted to see how cold it really is in there, and how much the heat fluctuates based on the outside temperature.
        To address this, I used a custom-built RaspberryPi temperature sensor, a MongoDB database, an AWS Lambda serverless function, and a
        React/Typescript frontend hosted on Netlify.
        Check out the README on Github for a walkthrough of how it all works behind the scenes!
