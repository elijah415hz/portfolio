                    I am a freelance classical singer turned web developer. As a singer I worked with some of the best professional 
                    choirs in the country, winning a Grammy Award as a soloist with one of them in 2018. I've been studying software development 
                    for the past few years, with the goal of pivoting into a new career that doesn't require me to be on the road so much. 
                    Losing all of my singing work at the beginning of the pandemic allowed me to start working full-time on making 
                    this career shift, and I've recently begun my new career with an internship at a young, fast-moving startup.

                    In my work as both a musician and developer I consider myself to be primarily a craftsman. My job is to know my tools well, 
                    and strive for elegance in my use of those tools. Iâ€™m passionate about my work, curious about everything, and effective at 
                    getting projects done on time and to a high standard.
